CECS 378 Ransomeware Project Repository
 
September 11, 2018: 
	This semester we are developing a file encryption program modeled after ransomeware. We leave out some of the more crtical pieces of it
	(for instance program distribution) and focus on the concepts related to the class such as confidentiality through encryption,
	integrity (using RSA signatures and HMAC) and some other things.	


Update December 15, 2018:
	We have uploaded all versions of the file encryption program devloped in python to a folder. Only the absolutely newest version is
	available from the root directory. There is a testing text file at root which was used during developement. 


To Do:

	Make program work with the node.js server we created. The plan is to have the server store the private key, and a list of the paired
	public keys from file encryption.
